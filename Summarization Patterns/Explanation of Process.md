## Summarization:

Summarizations are the second class of map reduce patterns. They can also use an additional step between the mapper and reducer, called the combiner.

These are examples of summarization:

1. Inverted indexing (like on the back of a book)

2. Numerical summarization (min, max, first, las, mean, median, count)
